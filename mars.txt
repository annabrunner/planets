MARS
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color.
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman.
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity.
Rich in iron, which will work well with my diet.

VENUS
Hot and wet, but everything is my favorite color.
The zero moons may be a problem for Wolfman.
But the Mummy will NOT appreciate the lack of humidity.
Because now we're on Venus.
